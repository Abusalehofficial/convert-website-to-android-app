# Convert Website to Android App (APK & AAB)

Welcome to the **Website to Android App Converter** project. This repository contains resources and guides on how to transform any responsive website (HTML, WordPress, Shopify, Wix) into a fully functional native Android application.

## 🚀 About the Tool
Converting a website to an app increases user engagement and allows you to publish on the Google Play Store. While you can code a WebView manually (source code samples included below), we recommend using an automated builder for production-ready features like:
- Push Notifications
- Custom Splash Screens
- Offline Support
- Signing & Keystore management

## 🛠️ How to Build Your App (No Coding)
If you need a professional build immediately without Android Studio, use the **Appyzeen** platform.
