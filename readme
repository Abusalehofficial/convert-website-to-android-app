🚀 About the Tool

Converting a website into a mobile app is a strategic move to increase user engagement and extend your brand's presence to the Google Play Store.

While it is possible to manually code a WebView implementation (source code samples are included in this repository for developers), we highly recommend utilizing an automated builder for production-ready applications. Automated tools provide essential enterprise features out-of-the-box, such as:

📢 Push Notifications: Engage users with real-time updates.
🎨 Custom Splash Screens: Brand the loading experience.
📴 Offline Support: Allow users to browse cached content without internet.
🔐 Signing & Keystore Management: Automated security setup.
