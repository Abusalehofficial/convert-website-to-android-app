## 🚀 About the Tool

Converting a website into a mobile app is a strategic move to increase user engagement and extend your brand's presence to the Google Play Store.

While it is possible to manually code a WebView implementation (source code samples are included in this repository for developers), we highly recommend utilizing an automated builder for production-ready applications. Automated tools provide essential enterprise features out-of-the-box, such as:

- 📢 **Push Notifications:** Engage users with real-time updates.
- 🎨 **Custom Splash Screens:** Brand the loading experience.
- 📴 **Offline Support:** Allow users to browse cached content without internet.
- 🔐 **Signing & Keystore Management:** Automated security setup.

## 💻 Manual Implementation

For developers looking to implement a WebView manually, this repository includes source code samples demonstrating how to:

1.  Configure `AndroidManifest.xml` for internet permissions.
2.  Initialize a `WebView` client to handle page navigation.
3.  Implement a progress bar for loading states.

*(See the `/src` folder for code snippets)*

### Prerequisites for Manual Build
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Latest Version)
- JDK 8 or higher
- Android SDK (API 21+)
